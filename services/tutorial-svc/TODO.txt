PROBLEMS TO FIX
-----------------
[ ] Prometheus does not include deployment.environment in the metric!
[ ] Remove net_protocol_name="http", net_protocol_version="1.1" from request count metric.


[ ] The OTEL_XXX env vars provide solid defaults for Resources: deployment env, service name, etc.
    However, they get clobbered after my Spring config bean runs? Don't need
    the spring config for this?

Experiments
====
-- grafana stack --
uses otel collector instead of their own agent...
https://github.com/grafana/intro-to-mlt#opentelemetry-collector
IMPORTANT: THis docker compose includes prometheus (instead of mirmir)...
https://github.com/grafana/tempo/blob/main/example/docker-compose/otel-collector/docker-compose.yaml
AND here https://github.com/grafana/tempo/blob/main/example/docker-compose/local/docker-compose.yaml

THIS MAY BE EASIEST docker compose and collector config... but no promtail.

-- best docker compose from grafana --
https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/installation/docker/
Should use this for loki and grafana docker-compose.yaml, etc.
Has best versions of stuff.


--PROMISING--
https://allopensourcetech.com/integrating-spring-boot-with-opentelemetry/
- setup pom.xml with javaagent
- setup docker app image for deployment w/ javaagent
- docker compose mounts volumes for promtail

-- clean docker compose --
Should try this out:
https://github.com/ThomasVitale/spring-cloud-gateway-resilience-security-observability/blob/main/docker-compose.yml

-- best architecture diagram ---
https://juejin.cn/post/7050134410229710884

-- good for collector deployment meeting ---
https://medium.com/@magstherdev/opentelemetry-operator-d3d407354cbf


-- LOKI --
I got logging setup with logback from this.
Their demo works for loki - https://levelup.gitconnected.com/spring-boot-with-grafana-loki-local-setup-included-442ebae2f599
with src - https://github.com/polovyivan/spring-with-grafana-loki
Mine crashes grafana when I try to connect to loki.




TODO
-----
[ ] Watch Aspecto video on collectors to understand details: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uKenOH1M8E
[ ] Watch video at 6:55 regarding stdout... https://isitobservable.io/observability/kubernetes/how-to-collect-logs-in-kubernetes-with-loki-and-promtail
[ ] Try out maven javaagent stuff - ttps://allopensourcetech.com/integrating-spring-boot-with-opentelemetry/
[ ] Update docker-compose and collector yaml file setup.
[ ] Add logging to demo stdout


[ ] refactor Dockerfiles
[ ] remove tool-config?
[ ] fix readmes
[ ] Add smoke tests in curl
[ ] update k6


DONE
----
[x] Update runMicroservice
[x] Resources 'deployment.environment' not showing up in traces
[x] Cleaner refactor to get tracer, meter injection.
[x] Get running local

[x] Get runnimg with parent docker compose
[X] Fix resources config
